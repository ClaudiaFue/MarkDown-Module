**Introduction:** 
> My name is Claudia Fuentes but my full name goes as Claudia Y. S. Fuentes

## A little bit about me

**Personal Life:** 
> I live with my mom and dad and my little sister. I also have an older sister who is married and with a child. My family is actually really big if you count all of the relatives from the other states like:
* Texas
* Tennessee
* Virginia
* Maryland
>Its also possible that there are more _unknown relatives_ as well because I only know some relatives from Texas and from Tennessee.
>But I also have family in El Salvador as well. But it is mostly just relatives and grandparents from both my mom and dads side.
>My dads family is located at Sensuntepeque, Cabanas while my moms side of the family is located at La Piraya which is an island where you need to get to a port from Usulutan to get to the island.
